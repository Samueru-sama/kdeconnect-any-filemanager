This script makes it very easy to use kdeconnect with file manager like Thunar, as it uses `kdeconnect-cli` and `qdbus-qt5` mount the phone and symlink its location to $HOME. It also supports phones with SD card. Example in Thunar and PCManFM:

How to use? 

Simply run the script every time your filemanager is opened, as due to limitations of kdeconnect a phone cannot be mounted the if device screen is turned off. For window manager users this as a simple as running the script alongside your filemager with the same hotkey.

Limitations? 

Right now you may only be able to use it to mount one phone at the time.
