This script makes it very easy to use kdeconnect with file manager like Thunar, as it uses `kdeconnect-cli` and either `qdbus6` or `qdbus-qt5` to mount the phone and symlink its location to $HOME. It also supports phones with SD card. Example in Thunar and PCManFM:

# How to use? 

Simply run the script once and that's it, it takes care of the rest including reconnecting the phone. Configure your DE/WM to start the script on login.

# Limitations? 

Right now you may only be able to use it to mount one phone at the time.
